## 🔄 New PDR Approval Workflow

### How It Works
1. **CEO Agent Created** → Auto-launches after timeline
2. **Workflow Runs Automatically**:
   - Research Agent gathers market data
   - Product Agent creates PDR
   - Status changes to "voting"
3. **Approve PDR** → Call endpoint:
   ```bash
   POST /api/ceo-agents/companies/:id/approve
   {
     "voter_id": "admin",
     "feedback": "Approved"
   }
   ```
4. **Marketing Auto-Posts**:
   - CMO generates strategy
   - Creates Twitter + LinkedIn posts
   - Publishes via Ayrshare
   - Records in database

### Endpoint
```
POST /api/ceo-agents/companies/:id/approve
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "voter_id": "admin",
  "feedback": "Looks great!"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "PDR approved and marketing initiated!",
  "company": {...},
  "workflow_state": "approved",
  "marketing_result": {
    "strategy": {...},
    "postResp": {
      "twitter": {...},
      "linkedin": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Testing the System

### Quick Test - Create & Approve a Company

```bash
# 1. Create a CEO agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/ceo-agents \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "TestCEO",
    "company_idea": "AI Plant Care",
    "description": "Smart IoT for plants",
    "ceo_characteristics": "Innovative",
    "token_symbol": "PLANT",
    "total_tokens": 100,
    "price_per_token": 5.0,
    "launch_timeline": 1,
    "time_duration": 60
  }'

# 2. Launch the agent (or wait for auto-launch)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/ceo-agents/:id/launch

# 3. Wait ~30 seconds for Research → Product workflow

# 4. Check workflow status
curl http://localhost:5001/api/company-workflow/:company_id

# 5. Approve PDR (triggers marketing)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/ceo-agents/companies/:id/approve \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"voter_id":"admin","feedback":"Approved!"}'

# 6. Check posts were created
curl http://localhost:5001/api/agents/activities
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **React build** not present - only API serving (frontend runs separately on port 3001)
2. **Marketing endpoint** takes ~20-30 seconds due to LLM calls
3. **Research uAgent** must be running separately for enriched marketing

---
