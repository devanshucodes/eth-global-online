# Workflow Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ CMO and CTO Agents Not Running After PDR Approval
**Problem**: When users clicked "Approve PDR", the CMO (Marketing) and CTO (Technical) agents didn't execute.

**Root Cause**: 
- The workflow vote endpoint (`/api/company-workflow/:companyId/vote`) only recorded the vote but didn't trigger the next workflow steps
- Frontend was trying to call `/api/agents/process-complete-workflow` which requires orchestrator uAgent on port 8008 (not running)

**Solution**:
1. Added CMO and CTO agent initialization to `routes/company-workflow.js`
2. Created `triggerMarketingAndTechnicalWorkflow()` function that:
   - Fetches workflow state with research and product data
   - Calls CMOAgent to generate marketing strategy
   - Calls CTOAgent to generate technical strategy
   - Saves results to database
3. Modified vote endpoint to automatically trigger this function when PDR is approved
4. Added `marketing_strategy` and `technical_strategy` columns to `company_workflow_state` table

### 2. ✅ Frontend 500 Error on Complete Workflow
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/agents/process-complete-workflow` which returned 500 errors.

**Root Cause**: This endpoint requires the orchestrator uAgent running on port 8008, which isn't started.

**Solution**:
- Removed frontend dependency on orchestrator endpoint
- Backend now handles full workflow automatically after PDR approval
- Frontend just reloads workflow state to display results

### 3. ✅ Frontend Not Displaying CMO/CTO Results
**Problem**: Even if CMO/CTO ran, frontend wasn't showing the results.

**Root Cause**: `loadCompanyWorkflow()` function wasn't checking for `marketing_strategy` and `technical_strategy` fields.

**Solution**:
- Updated `loadCompanyWorkflow()` to:
  - Check for `marketing_strategy` and set state
  - Check for `technical_strategy` and set state
  - Display proper activity messages for each completed agent
  - Handle 'complete' workflow step

## Files Modified

1. **routes/company-workflow.js**
   - Added CMOAgent and CTOAgent imports
   - Added `triggerMarketingAndTechnicalWorkflow()` function
   - Modified vote endpoint to trigger workflow on approval

2. **database/add_marketing_technical_columns.sql** (NEW)
   - Migration to add marketing_strategy and technical_strategy columns

3. **client/src/App.js**
   - Updated vote handler to remove broken orchestrator call
   - Updated `loadCompanyWorkflow()` to display marketing and technical strategies
   - Improved activity feed messages

## How It Works Now

### Complete Workflow Flow:
1. User launches CEO agent → Company created
2. Backend auto-starts Research Agent → saves research data
3. Backend auto-starts Product Agent → saves product data
4. Workflow status becomes "voting" (PDR ready)
5. User clicks "✅ APPROVE PDR"
6. Vote recorded in database
7. **Backend automatically triggers CMO and CTO agents** (NEW!)
8. CMO generates marketing strategy → saved to DB
9. CTO generates technical strategy → saved to DB
10. Workflow status becomes "complete"
11. Frontend reloads and displays all results

## Testing

To test the full workflow:

1. Start backend:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/apple/Desktop/eth-global2025 copy"
   PORT=5001 node server.js
   ```

2. Start frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   PORT=3001 npm start
   ```

3. In browser (http://localhost:3001):
   - Create a CEO agent
   - Wait for it to launch (check timer)
   - Company dashboard will show research → product → voting
   - Click "✅ APPROVE PDR"
   - Wait ~10-30 seconds for CMO and CTO to complete
   - Reload the company dashboard to see marketing and technical strategies

## What Still Needs Work

1. **Head of Engineering Agent** - Not yet wired to create Bolt prompts after CTO
2. **Real-time updates** - Frontend needs to poll or use websockets to show live progress
3. **Error handling** - Better fallbacks if CMO/CTO fail
4. **Social posting** - Ayrshare integration (planned for marketing agent)

## Notes

- CMO and CTO now use ASI:One API with fallback strategies if API fails
- All workflow data persists in SQLite database
- No Python uAgents required for this workflow (all Node.js)
- Orchestrator endpoint still exists but isn't used in this flow
